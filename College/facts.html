    <p>Indian cuisine is part of the landscape in most cities across America. Indian dishes aren’t just curries, chutney, and chicken tikka masala, there’s a lot more to Indian food than you ever knew!</p>
    <h1>1. India is the Spice Capital of the World</h1>
    <p>The reason that India became the world’s Spice Capital and garnered so much interest from across the world was because of its vast geographical expanse, marked by diverse climate zones, which made it possible to cultivate an astonishing array of spices, not possible in many other countries across the globe.India produces more than 70 percent of the spices used in the world. It has a greater variety of spices than any other country. Black pepper is considered the “king” spice, dating back as early as 2,000 B.C.E. In ancient times black pepper was highly prized, almost regarded as black gold. Although salt is found in many places around the world, black pepper is indigenous to a province in South India.</p>
    <h1>2. Not All Indian Dishes Are Spicy</h1>
    <p>Northern Indian cuisine uses more milk products than that of southern India. It’s also less spicy than southern cuisine. Most American restaurants offer different levels of heat for most dishes on the menu.Not every dish made in India uses an excessive number of spices! Thukpa from northeast and mandua ki roti from Uttrakhand are some examples of Indian food that are not at all spicy. </p>
    <h1>3. There Are Over 200 Indian Desserts</h1>
    <p>Indian desserts and sweets are often called Mithais. Although many buffets focus on Kheer, a traditional rice pudding, or Gulab Jamun, Indian milk balls served with honey syrup, there’s a wide variety of desserts in the country. The most traditional desserts are made with fruit and honey because it was the Portuguese who introduced sugar to the country.Indian desserts have a unique flavor profile, often using ingredients like milk, sugar, nuts, spices, ghee, flour and fruits. Some of the most popular Indian desserts are gulab jamun, rasgulla, jalebi, kheer, kulfi, laddu, barfi and halwa.</p>
    <p>Indian desserts are a significant element in Indian cuisine and culture, especially during festivals and celebrations like Diwali, Holi, Eid and Raksha Bandhan2 Different regions of India have their own specialties and variations of desserts, such as Bengali sandesh, Rajasthani ghevar, Gujarati basundi, Punjabi pinni and South Indian payasam1</p>
    <h1>4. Not Everyone in India Is Vegetarian</h1>
    <p>Although India does have low rates of meat consumption per person, only about 29 percent of the population follows a strict vegetarian diet. Goat, chicken, and lamb are popular meats used in many dishes. Seafood is also popular in coastal areas.</p>
    <h1>5. Many Popular Ingredients and Dishes Are Borrowed</h1>
    <p>Potatoes, tomatoes, and chilies didn’t originate in Indian cuisine. Portuguese traders introduced these items to the country in the 15th and 16th centuries. Saffron was likely brought to India by Greek or Roman traders. Naan bread, which is traditionally associated with Indian cuisine, most likely originated in Persia, in the 1300s. The popular Indian dish, Chicken Tikka Masala was first made in Scotland in 1971.</p>
    <h1>6. A Cook’s Reputation Is Often Based on Their Curry</h1>
    <p>An excellent Indian curry balances spices in perfect proportion. Every cook has its own blend. Every region has different characteristics of a good curry. Incidentally, the word curry is rarely used in India.</p>
    <h1>7. Chai Is an Ancient Drink</h1>
    <p>Chai, a spiced tea drink, is thought to be a healing beverage, dating back to an ancient royal court over 5,000 years ago. It wasn’t until the 1930s that it added black tea. Coffee was probably introduced to the Indian culture by the British.</p>
